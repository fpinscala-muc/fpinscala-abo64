# Testing with ScalaTest and ScalaCheck

## Why tests?
* find bugs
* "prove" correctness (= meets expectations/specifications)
* specify behavior ("test first", TTD)
* document and communicate behavior
* fixate behavior (e.g. before refactoring code)
* acceptance criteria (e.g. for product management department)
* avoid future regressions
* explore unknown code
* good feeling (sleep better)

A good testing framework should support all these goals well (especially a good feeling).
